      <h1>JavaScript â€” Dynamic client-side scripting</h1>

      <p class="info">
        Javascript is a programming language that allows us to implement complex
        functionalities on web pages.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        JavaScript is a scripting language that enables us to create dynamically
        updating content, control multimedia, animate images.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common
        programming features that allow you to do things like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for
          instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in
          a variable called <span>name</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).
        </li>
        <li>
          Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We
          used a <span>click</span> event in our example above to detect when
          the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text
          label.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Comments in JS</h2>
      <p class="info">
        JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make
        it more readable. JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent
        execution, when testing alternative code.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Single line comments start with //. Any text between // and the end of
        the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. Any text between /*
        and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
      </p>
      <h2>Variables in JS</h2>
      <p class="info">
        Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        We declare JavaScript variables with <span>var</span>,<span>let</span>,
        or <span>const</span>. The <span>var</span> keyword is used in all
        JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. The <span>let</span> and
        <span>const</span> keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. If we want
        our code to run in older browsers, we must use <span>var</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        If we need a general rule: always declare variables with
        <span>const</span>. If the value of the variable can change, use
        <span>let</span>.
      </p>
      <h2>JavaScript Identifiers</h2>
      <p class="info">
        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
        unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names
        (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). The
        general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers)
        are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).
        </li>
        <li>Names must begin with a letter.</li>
        <li>Names can also begin with $ and _ .</li>
        <li>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).</li>
        <li>
          Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p class="info">
        let firstName = Evgenia;<br />
        let lastName = Sergeeva;<br />
        let age = 44;<br />
        let city = "Kharkiv";<br />
        let _course = 'Front-end';<br />
        let $dateOfBeginning = '09/11/2022'<br />
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        let 44 = 44 // names of variables cannot start with number<br />
        let function = f (x) // reserved words cannot act as names<br />
        let const = 55 // reserved words cannot act as names<br />
        let 1 = 1 // names of variables cannot start with number<br />
      </p>
