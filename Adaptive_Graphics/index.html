          FashHanger is a bespoke sustainable high-fashion accessory company
          based out of Berlin, currently operated by Siesly and her sister
          Ashely. They needed help for a big rebrand and wanted to relaunch
          their website.

          Their goals were simple, create a unique e-commerce store that bring a
          wonderful shopping experience at every stage of the buyer’s journey.

          the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs
          personality test. According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16
          potential user personality types. Our template integrates questions
          from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar
          graphics. If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out
          the Myers Briggs basics article.

          I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what
          I’m working on (and find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer
          paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the
          time perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.

          I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead
          you in to each screen. For each of those screens I added a floating
          footer that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow
          and jump around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made
          wireframe.
